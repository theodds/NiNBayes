Description: At the moment, this package fits the infinite product-mixture multinomial model described by Linero and Daniels (2017, to appear in Statistical Science) to missing data problems. The package allows for multiple imputation under a number of different identifying restrictions, as well as computation of intention-to-treat effects by Monte Carlo integration.
